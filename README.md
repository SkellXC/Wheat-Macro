A macro for minecraft that places wheat, applies bonemeal until its fully grown and then breaks it. 
This was originally made to be used in a server so it runs a /sell command to clear the wheat when my inventory is full.

The program detects that your inventory is full by checking the pixels on screen to see if they are red (as an "Inventory Full" message pops up).

Requires Pyautogui and Keyboard to be installed.
